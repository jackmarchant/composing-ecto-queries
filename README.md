# Composing Ecto Queries

This is a sample application that I built while writing a blog post about Composing Ecto Queries.

It's not very sophisticated but hopefully illustrates the basics and some more powerful features of Ecto queries.

## Getting started
1. Clone this repo
2. Set up a local Postgres database and edit [the config](./config/config.exs)
3. Run `mix install`
4. Run `mix test` to see everything working correctly.
